    <h2>Description</h2>
    
    <p>Sesame Chicken is a staple of Chinese-American cuisine, famous for its perfect balance of crunchy, sweet, and savory flavors</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>4 boneless skinless chicken breasts cut into bite-sized pieces</li>
        <li>2 tablespoon cornstarch</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon black pepper</li>
        <li>1/4 cup vegetable oil</li>
        <li>1/4 cup honey</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons sesame oil</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons toasted sesame seeds</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>Whisk cornstarch, salt, and black pepper together in a bowl; add chicken and toss to coat</li>
        <li>Heat the oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Cook the chicken in batches, turning it from time to time, until it's lightly golden, about 5 minutes</li>
        <li>In a small bowl, mix together the honey, sesame oil, and 1 tablespoon of the sesame seeds until well combined</li>
        <li>Add the sauce to the skillet with the chicken and stir to evenly coat. Lower the heat to medium-low and let it simmer until the sauce thickens and the chicken is fully cooked</li>
        <li>Finish by sprinkling the remaining sesame seeds on top</li>
    </ol>
